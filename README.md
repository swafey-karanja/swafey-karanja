## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Samuel Karanja
## About Me
I am a young man with an enthusiasm and passion for tech, Front End development, Web Development and AI.
I enjoy developing full-stack applications in particular the front-end using javascript frameworks such as Angular and React.js. Currently, I am learning to use Next.js with Tailwind css.
In addition, I have experience developing AI applications using Python and have some experience with PHP though there remains room for improvement.
ðŸŒ± I am looking to further increase my experience with front-end technologies related to Javascript and in future increase my knowledge in AI.
