## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Samuel Karanja. I am a young man with an enthusiasm and passion for tech, development work and AI.
I enjoy developing front-end applications in particular using javascript frameworks such as angular and react.js. Currently, I am learning to use next.js with tailwind css.
In addition, I have experience developing AI applications using python and have some experience with PHP though there remains room for improvement.
ðŸŒ± I am looking to further increase my experience with front-end technologies related to javascript and in future increase my knowledge in AI.

âš¡ Fun Fact about me: I enjoy anime(my favourite being hunter x hunter and Jujutsu kaisen) and football being a fan of Liverpool football club.
